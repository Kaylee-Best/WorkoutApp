# WorkoutApp

For this part of the project I modified lab 5.

For this, I added 2 new components, one that creates a new repetition exercise and one that creates a new duration exercise.

For the repetition exercise, I gave the user the ability to name the exercise and to set how many reps they want to do. To do this, I used useState to allow the counter to work. It's initial parameter is 0.

For the duration exercise, I gave the user the ability to name the exercise and set how long they want the exercise to last in minutes. Like for the repetition exercise, I used useState to measure the minutes with its initial parameter set to 0.
